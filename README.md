# Powster Creative Coding Test
Congratulations on getting to test exercise. We hope you will use this opportunity to best showcase your talents and abilities.

The exercise should not take you longer than 3 hours. 

# Exercise
Powster works almost on every movie release around the globe. And we hope to encourage as many people as possible to buy tickets and see the screening. One of our main challenges is to make the use of our vast collection of data and present in an exciting and engaging way.

Your task is to load the sample JSON data into your web application and create interactive globe visualization.

You can fetch the screenings from url below
https://labs.pow.io/coding-test/data.json
Don't worry if some locations do not make sense. We needed to randomize it a bit.

Each data record will have:
{
  time: String<ISO 8601>,
  lat: Number,
  lon: Number,
  theaterName: String
}

Inspirations:


Specifications:
* Your work should be written in JavaScript. The code must be delivered in readable format
* Your work must work within the browser
* The end result should be interactive
* We leave the style of your project up to you. Showcase your creativity. If you are looking for inspirations, use any recent movie release!
* You do not need to use Earth textures. Mars, Discoball are equally fine
* Use any WebGL library. This includes Three.js or other lower-level libraries
* Create your own GIT project and invite us as contributors
* Your GIT project should include an instruction to run the solution

Bonus: You can inspect each of the data point (i.e. by clicking on it)
