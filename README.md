# Powster Creative Coding Test
Congratulations on getting to the test exercise. We hope you will use this opportunity to showcase your talents and abilities.

The exercise should take you no longer than 3 hours. 

## Exercise
Powster works on almost every movie released around the globe. We hope to encourage as many users as possible to buy tickets and see the screening. One of our main challenges is to make use of our vast collection of data and present it in an exciting and engaging way.

Your task is to load the sample JSON data into your web application and create interactive globe visualization.

## Specifications:
* Your work should be written in JavaScript. The code must be delivered in readable format
* Your assignment must work within the browser
* The end result should be interactive
* We leave the style of your project up to you. Showcase your creativity. If you are looking for inspiration, use any recent movie release!
* You do not need to use Earth textures. Mars, Discoball etc are equally fine
* Use any WebGL library. This includes Three.js or other lower-level libraries
* Create your own GIT project and invite us as contributors
* Your GIT project should include an instruction to run the solution

Bonus: You can inspect each of the data point (i.e. by clicking on it)

## Data
You can fetch the screenings from url below
https://labs.pow.io/coding-test/data.json
Don't worry if some locations do not make sense. We needed to randomize it a bit.

Each data record will have:
```
{
  time: String<ISO 8601>,
  lat: Number,
  lon: Number,
  theaterName: String
}
```
